<p>Today I ran into an awkward situation. I am in China right now and I need proxy to access internet. So I set the global proxy of terminal.</p>
<p>I executed a program and it needs to upload image to image bed, which is an server in China. The procedure is: the program executes uploading commands via terminal, while the terminal has proxy settings. So itâ€™s really awkward that the uploading failed.</p>
<p>I spent sevel hours for debugging and write this blog for people whom have ran into the same pitfall.</p>
