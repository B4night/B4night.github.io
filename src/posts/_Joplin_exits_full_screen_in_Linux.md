# Joplin exits full screen in Linux

Today I maximized joplin when I was using it. But when I wanted to change the options, I used `f11` to exit full screen. However, `f11` is bonded to another feature, so that I canâ€™t use it to exit.

Here is the solution.

1.  Find the file `window-state-prod.json `Use the command `find / -name "window-state-prod.json`
2.  Edit the json file and set `isFullScreen` to `false`
