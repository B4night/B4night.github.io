# So excited about my first macbook

I started using `windows` operating system since I was 10 years old. After 12 years of using that(basically playing games on it) and 3 years of using Linux(ubuntu and fedora),  I am about to have my first `Mac OS` device.

It's 4 am in the morning and I could not sleep. I am soo excited and can't wait to try another `UNIX-LIKE` system. Recently I mainly use `Fedora38` and I like it pretty much, although sometimes it runs into system or application crashes.

I heard that mac-book is the best choice for programmers. Can't wait to see it.
